#' @title Determine taxa that are common (core) across sample types
#' @description This function returns a data frame with taxa that meet 
#'  proportion user thresholds and are determined to be common across multiple 
#'  sample types.
#' @param input The input dataset as loaded by \code{load_taxa_table()}.
#' @param type_header Mapping file header (in quotation marks) of factor for 
#'  which you are testing for differences.
#' @param prop_types The proportion of sample types in which a taxon must
#'  be present to be considered core.
#' @param prop_reps The proportion of replicate samples within a sample type
#'  in which a taxon must be present to be considered core.
#' @return A data frame with each core taxon as a row. The proportion of sample
#'  types where the taxon was present, the mean count of each 
#'  sample type, and the corresponding taxonomy (if provided), are also 
#'  returned.
