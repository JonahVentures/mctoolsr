#' mctoolsr: Microbial Community Data Analysis Tools
#' 
#' The mctoolsr package provides various functions for facilitating data 
#' analysis of microbial communities as determined using high throughput 
#' sequenceing. The tools generally start with the taxon table and associated 
#' metadata after the initial processing has been accomplished.
#' 
#' @section Loading data into R using mctoolsr
#' @details There are multiple functions used to load in data, but the most useful is:
#' \code{load_taxon_table()}. This function will make sure your community data and 
#' metadata correspond to one another and the samples are in the same order.
